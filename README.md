# Model-selection

Hypothesis based Feature selection
1) Yields sensible and general purpose features that can be extended to other data

TF-IDF vectors (Textual data):
1) Modelling process is time consuming due to computational constraints
2) Yields features and words very specific to this data

Decision Boundary Analysis:
1) Draw the bi-variate plots of the target variables against the individual metrics, and this will allow to see the relationship is linear or non linearr

Size of the data:
1) Non Linear models gives better results on bigger size of data when compared to smaller data set size

Fklexibility of the model : Non Linear models are more flexible than Linear models and show better non linear relationship

Comprehensibility to the user: Does the user prefer numeric functions or decision rules? Numeric functions will use Linear models v/s decision rules will use non linear models

Underlying phenomenon: IS there a lot of data engineering that has to be done, in order to get good results sfrom the linear model? If yes, then non linear models can be considered

Characteristics of the data: Non Linear models are more robust to missing values, types of variables, relationships among variables, number of irrelevant variables

Missing values: Another feature which saves data prep time: missing values will not prevent splitting the data for building non linear models.

Outliers: Non linear models are not sensitive to outliers since the splitting happens based on proportion of samples within the split ranges and not on absolute values.
